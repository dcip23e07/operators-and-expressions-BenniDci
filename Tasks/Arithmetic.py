# print(var_a) # will have an integer as result
# print(var_b) # will have a float as result 
# the combined print(result) is considert a float cause it has the 0.0 from var_b init  
# so different Data Types as results

# 3. 
# var_c = 1000/5 
# is an integer as an object cause the result is 200

# 4.
# var_d = 1200 + "200"
# print(var_d) will have 1200200 as result first showing the integer 1200 than the string 200 after that 
# if we want 200 as int we have to convert it

# 5.
# var_e = "3004" + "996"
# var_e is considert a string cause and the value is 3004996
